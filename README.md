# Micro-Tabla
We develop a Finite Difference numerical model to simulate and analyse the vibrations of non-homogeneous damped circular plates with microscopic dimensions. This analysis shows an improvement of the quality factor of the plates vibrations in certain loading regimes. These results can be used as manufacturing guidelines for nanodevices.
